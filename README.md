# StabOps

Oh look! I've been gifted a cool domain name. Really. That's all there is to it. I'm crowdsourcing a chunk of the content, so roll up your sleeves and start sharing.

Submit a PR and add your DevSecOps failures/nightmares/challenges. This isn't meant to shame any person or company, but rather serve as a tool for others. Anonymous submissions are fine. Let's try to learn from one another.

When you write up what went wrong, make sure you include what you or your team could've done better. Sometimes stuff just goes wrong and that's ok, too. Figure out something cool in the failure process? Let the world know.

If you have something you'd like to share but feel like it's more Dev or Sec or Ops than DevSecOps, that's ok, too. No one is here to judge. I kinda hate siloed teams anyway. 

If you don't know what any of this means but want to learn, check out the manifesto on https://www.devsecops.org/
